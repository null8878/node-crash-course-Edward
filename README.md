Project Name: Node Crash Course - Module 3

Purpose: Assignment for SDEV 255, Module 3  
Description:

This project follows the Node.js crash-course structure by setting up basic routing, serving HTML files, and running a Node/Express server. The GitHub Pages link hosts the static front-end, but the actual Node server runs locally because GitHub Pages does not support backend servers.
